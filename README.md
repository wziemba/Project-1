# Project-1
For the first project

Project Description
Create three HTML pages, each with one desktop size page-scroll worth of content. One of the pages must be your professional resume. The themes of the other two are your choice.

Deliverables & Milestones (see calender for due dates)

First Deliverable: Create a Basecamp post. Title the post with your name and project number (example Daniel Krieglstein: Project 1). Your post should include:

The URL to your Project 1 GitHub repository, and the URL to your index.html Github Pages live link

Three screen capture images of successful html validation. One for each website page.

Two questions eliciting feedback from fellow students

Second Deliverable: Give constructive comments to help at least three other students. Post a picture of those three comments on your Basecamp folder.

Final Deliverable: You will receive a list on your Basecamp post of required fixes from the professor or TA. Fix your code and edit your original Basecamp post with the words "FINAL TURN IN"
Requirements

NO CSS IN YOUR HTML FILE!!! This means no style at all. No spacing, no centering, no color, no italics. Just raw html.

Absolutely no br tags or use of tables for layout. This is also considered style.

Two spaces indented cascade. Each child element should be indented 2 space right of its parent.

Three images of HTML validation, one for each page. W3C HTML validator (-50% if it doesn't validate)

Create a bulleted list at the top of each page. The list items will be the file names of all 3 pages. This is your basic navigation.

Include at least three HTML images and one other form of media (audio or video)

Do not use any pre-build code or frameworks. Write it all from scratch.

Directory-based file structure for links and media. Do not use full URLs when linking to your own content. Example: "css/screen.css" vs. "https://dkriegls.github.io/itmd-361-spring2018/css/screen.css"

At least 10 commits to your Github repository; with meaningful commit messages that accurately reflect your changes

Git repository must contain only the files and commits from this project. Each website you make for this class should have its own repository.
